# Duende Free and Open Source Software
This repository contains Duende's Free and Open Source Software.

- [Duende.AccessTokenManagement](/access-token-management/) .NET libraries that
  manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens.
- [Duende.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth2Introspection](/introspection) ASP.NET Authentication
  handler for OAuth 2.0 introspection.
- [Duende.IdentityModel](/identity-model/) .NET libraries for claims-based
  identity, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- [Duende.IdentityModel.OidcClient](/identity-model-oidc-client/) .NET libraries
  for building OpenID Connect (OIDC) native clients

## Relationship to IdentityModel
Several of the libraries within this repository used to be found in the
[IdentityModel](https://github.com/IdentityModel/IdentityModel) GitHub organization. Those
projects have been renamed with the prefix "Duende" to reflect that they are all
maintained by Duende Software and are designed to work well together. The name change
doesn't indicate other big changes: Duende Software is the company Brock and Dominick
founded, they remain involved in these libraries, and we are committed to keeping them
open source.
